# league_predictor
A simple machine learning model that can predict who will win a game of League of Legends after the first 10 minutes.

## Why?
Why not! This was a fun project to get some rough and basic understanding of using TensorFlow and working on linear regression problems. It's sure as hell not practical, but at least I can tell you with great discomfort and uncertainty whether or not you'll win your League game based on data you won't have!

## I Want to Try!
Great! First you can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min).
After that, go ahead and run the dataMaker.py file to create and filter training and testing datasets which are saved as pickle files.

Following, use simply run app.py...

## ToDo
[x] Process the data
[ ] Create and test a model
[ ] Run predictions
[ ] Repeat steps 2-3 until 95% accuracy or more.
